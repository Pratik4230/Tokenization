# Tokenization

A simple React + Vite app that demonstrates a custom tokenizer with fixed IDs for letters, symbols, common words, and special sentences, plus a small UI to visualize tokens and their numeric IDs.

## Prerequisites

- Bun (recommended)
  - Install: https://bun.sh
  - Verify: `bun --version`

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install
```

## Development

```bash
# Start the dev server (Vite)
bun run dev
```

- Open the app at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

## Build

```bash
# Type-check and build for production
bun run build
```

- Output is generated by Vite in the `dist/` folder.

## Preview (local production preview)

```bash
# Serve the production build locally
bun run preview
```

## Lint

```bash
bun run lint
```

## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` — start the Vite dev server
- `bun run build` — type-check and build production assets
- `bun run preview` — preview the built app locally
- `bun run lint` — run ESLint

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS (v4)

## Notes

- The tokenizer logic lives in `src/lib/simpleTokenizer.ts`.
- The demo UI is in `src/components/TokenizationUI.tsx` and rendered from `src/App.tsx`.
- Bun is compatible with the existing npm scripts via `bun run <script>`.
